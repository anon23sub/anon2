Q. Can you explain the decision-making process behind choosing the standard deviation for the added noise for smoothing? How does this choice affect the model's calibration error? [Reviewer#1 Q1]

We had previously chosen the standard deviation for the added noise based on some initial experiments. However, we agree with the suggestion that there should be a principled way of choosing this. Thus, we now divide the training data into training and validation. We divide the validation dataset from the training dataset. Thus, it is independent of the calibration dataset. For our experiments for validation, the validation dataset is used for calibration. We test the performance on the test dataset through calibration errors.

We perform validation with performance measured on the validation set and choose that value of standard deviation which gives the lowest calibration error. We then report the calibration errors on test dataset using value of standard deviation from above for smoothing.

We try varying values of standard deviation for calibration ranging from 0.01 all the way to 10. The model over here is Conformalized Quantile Regression. 

This choice affects the modelâ€™s calibration error in this manner: till the optimal value of standard deviation, the calibration error reduces, but after this, the errors would change too much, resulting in an increase in calibration error. The effect of the choice of standard deviation is shown in Table 4. For each appliance, this behavior varies.
